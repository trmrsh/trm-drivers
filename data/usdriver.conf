#
# RTPLOT_SERVER_ON      = Whether to switch the rtplot server on or not
#                         [YES/NO]. You may well want to use this while observing,
#                         probably not otherwise, not that it will do any harm.
#
# ULTRACAM_SERVERS_ON   = This controls enabling of all actions to do with the
#                         servers. It does no harm to leave it on, but if you
#                         turn it off, it will prevent you from even trying to 
#                         interact with the servers.
#
# EXPERT_LEVEL          = 0 -- program stops you doing things out of order.
#                              Simplifies setup menu as far as possible.
#                         1 -- program still stops you doing things out of order,
#                              but offers a more detailed setup window.
#                         2 -- guru status: all buttons enabled. Its up to you to
#                              use them correctly.
#
# FILE_LOGGING_ON       = if yes, then (most) items printed in the
#                         left-hand short-format window are also sent
#                         to a file. They are appended if the file
#                         already exists. The file is written as an html table
#                         with times and could be useful information to retain 
#                         after a run. Some error messages sent to the window
#                         may not be saved if they are of no interest except at 
#                         the time of running.

#
# HTTP_CAMERA_SERVER    = The URL of ULTRACAM camera server. The port number is
#                         unlikely to change but the rest of the URL could
#                         depending whether you run on the rack PC (localhost)
#                         or not.
#
# HTTP_DATA_SERVER      = URL of ULTRACAM data server. See comment on the camera

# TEMPLATE_FROM_SERVER  = Get template files from the server, else they will be taken
#                         from TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY. Taking them from the server
#                         is perhaps more "from the horse's mouth", but it
#                         requires the server to be working of course. The
#                         template file in question are those defining the
#                         windows. Others are expected to be in the standard

#                         any change of setup without a corresponding change of
#                         target. This is a safety device.
#
