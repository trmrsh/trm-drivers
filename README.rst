'drivers' provides GUIs to run the high-speed cameras ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC.
It is currently under active development. 'drivers' is written in Python
and is based on Tkinter. It could be a useful example of a fairly complex GUI
as it contains examples of talking to servers, subprocesses, and simultaneous
operations as a server which raises issues to do with threading.
