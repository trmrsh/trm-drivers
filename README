This is a development directory for Python replacements for the Java GUIs
currently used to run ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC. Basic reason is that Python 
is so much cleaner and quicker to develop in which will make it easier to
incorporate extra features for the Thai telescope, in particular checks on
telescope position etc.
